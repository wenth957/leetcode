Submission xgboost weighted 2 back 11-0 no zeroing, linear normalisation joint, linear normalisation marginal (no .7z. version)
is identical to 22-11-2016/xgboost weighted back 11-0 zero prods 10, 11, 12 and 14 linear normalisation
As expected! But the marginals should be more correct and applying an exponential transformation to them should result in a different submission!
